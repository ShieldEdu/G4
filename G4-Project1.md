Our goal is to enhance our middle school students' comprehension, summarization, and presentation skills. By integrating technology, we aim to create an engaging learning experience that prepares them for the digital age. We'll be utilizing three powerful tools: ChatGPT 4.0, Leonardo, and ElevenLabs, alongside carefully selected news articles. These tools will help us simplify complex texts, create related images, and convert texts into engaging audio presentations.



<br>

<h3>üìëLesson Plan</h3>

- **Step 1: We start by introducing the lesson's objective and grouping our students, assigning one news article to each group.**
  
- **Step 2: Each group will then use ChatGPT 4.0 to simplify their article. They'll ensure the content is understandable to younger audiences while maintaining its core message. This step not only enhances reading comprehension but also encourages critical thinking.**

- **Step 3: Moving on, students will use the Leonardo AI application to create visuals related to their simplified articles. This encourages creativity and helps students understand the importance of visual aids in communication.**

- **Step 4: With ElevenLabs, each group transforms their simplified text into audio. This introduces students to text-to-speech technology, adding an auditory layer to their presentations.**

- **Step 5: Finally, students will combine their simplified articles, images, and audio into a cohesive multimedia presentation. This comprehensive activity not only solidifies their understanding of the topic but also polishes their public speaking and technical skills."**

<br>

Each group will present their work, allowing for peer feedback and teacher evaluation. We assess based on the simplicity and accuracy of the content, creativity of the images, quality of the audio, and presentation skills. This lesson plan not only teaches language and digital literacy but also fosters creativity, critical thinking, and technological proficiency. By integrating AI tools into the classroom, we prepare our students for a future where technology and communication go hand in hand.

## Rationale


#### Q1 What are the unique advantages of using this tool for English learning or teaching? Identify the benefits this tool offers, focusing on concrete examples that highlight these advantages in practice.

```
ChatGPT
```
+ ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI, and one of the main functions is:

Natural Language Understanding: ChatGPT uses natural language processing and understanding technology to comprehend and respond to user questions or requests.

+ A ways to utilize ChatGPT for English learning or educational purposes:

English Reading Comprehension: ChatGPT can assist users in summarizing or interpreting English articles or texts. The model can help users summarize specific articles or grasp the main content of a text.

***For example, here's how to use ChatGPT for English learning:***

***User: "ChatGPT, could you summarize one of the recently published articles?"***

***ChatGPT: "Of course. Let me summarize the article 'NASA's New Space Exploration Mission' that was recently published."***

***User: "Thank you!"***

***ChatGPT: "NASA has announced a new space exploration mission. This mission focuses on exploring the surface of Mars and measuring the distance between Earth and Mars. It is expected to provide new insights into space exploration."***

<br>

```
Leonardo AI
```
+ Leonardo AI is an artificial intelligence tool for image generation and editing. One of the main features is:

Image Generation: Leonardo AI can generate images based on text or user requests, allowing for creative and engaging visuals.

+ For English learning or educational purposes, Leonardo AI can be utilized in the following ways:

1. Creative Image Generation: English learners can use Leonardo AI to generate creative images and write accompanying English sentences, fostering language skills and creativity simultaneously.

## Rationale

#### Q1 

#### Q2 How do you envision this tool evolving or impacting English teaching methods in the future? Speculate on the future implications of this tool, including a detailed vision of how it might develop or be integrated into innovative teaching strategies.

In the future, we believe that due to the development of AI, learners will conduct individualized and personalized learning in an individualized way.

In particular, in the field of English writing, since AI Chatbots have emerged that write with perfect grammar and perfect logic, there will be little meaning in grading the writing results. Therefore, when evaluating English writing, you should evaluate the English writing process, not the product.


Since AI will become a tool that must coexist in all educational processes, I believe that rather than blindly excluding it from the educational field, we should change the evaluation method and conduct a lot of research on how AI can be utilized in the educational context. 

#### Q3 Can this tool be used to facilitate collaboration among students or between students and teachers? How? Explore the tool‚Äôs collaborative features, providing detailed instructions or a step-by-step guide on how these can be used for group projects or discussions.



#### Q4 What are the potential challenges or limitations of using this tool in an English learning or teaching context? Analyze any drawbacks, suggesting practical solutions or workarounds with detailed explanations.
There was a problem with synchronizing AI-generated scripts and AI-made videos; the content did not always align properly. Therefore, it is advisable for teachers to thoroughly create and edit the content before letting AI avatars present it. 

Using Leonardo AI to create images can result in each child producing distinct images. This might lead to a lack of consistency and unity when collaborating to create a single news piece. Additionally, problems can arise when generating images based solely on text without understanding the context. For example, if asked to draw Korean food like "altang," it might produce an image like this.
