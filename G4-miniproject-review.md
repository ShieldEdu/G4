# ðŸ’™ AI tools: ChatGPT, Elevens labs, Leonardo (review)

This group used an artificial intelligence digital tool for video production, which was impressive. Using AI tools for English learning is very close to becoming a reality in future classrooms. Therefore, it is a good attempt to plan language learning that enables students to use AI tools. However, it would have been better if more specific instructional and language learning objectives had been set, and if some hints on how to concretely use them were shown. The variety and abundance of tools are significant, but the more important question is how English teachers can use them concretely. Introducing a variety of tools was helpful, but the presentation would have been better if it had included specific examples of how these tools could be applied in actual activities. Aside from that, I think the presentation was clearly well communicated to the audience.

|R1| I like your video presentation!|
|R2	|It was such a fantastic job!:) |
|R3	|Unlike other groups, we used three different apps. Firstly, we focused on teaching students how to integrate different types of apps and emphasized whether children can practically learn using digital apps. Firstly, using ChatGPT helped students understand difficult news articles by summarizing the content with words suitable for their level. Secondly, utilizing Leonardo AI enabled children to create appropriate illustrations for the news, demonstrating their comprehension of the content. Lastly, ElevenLabs allowed students to listen to news summaries with accurate pronunciation, which could be integrated into discussion and presentation classes. While the use of digital tools is essential rather than optional, I don't believe it necessarily leads to reducing the steps of learning or minimizing education. Additionally, as other teachers have pointed out, while these digital tools may not currently provide excellent results, I think that using them in lessons will undoubtedly be helpful to students once better versions of AI are available in the future.|
|R4|Thanks for your presentation. First, I was impressed by the integration of three trendy tools into a single lesson. The lesson plan was well-structured and easy to follow. It was beneficial to see the functions and examples of each tool demonstrated, and the in-depth explanation of the rationale provided valuable insights. During the presentation, I found myself curious about the the target learner's age and skill level, as well as how the prompt training would be implemented. The ideas presented were thought-provoking. Thank you!|
|R5	|Great presentation! I like the character talking very naturally with some gestures in the video. It seemed like a real person! The idea of using 3 tools for the lesson was well organized. By the way, I'm not sure the summary would be comprehensible to young learners even though it is summarized by GPT. I think you can add more prompt to adjust the level of the input when you use GPT! Except for this point, it was well-planned lesson!|
|R6	|Introduced various tools, but all of them seem not easy to use.|
|R7	|The information you gave in the md file and the video was solid. Drawing out different functions from each AI tool looks creative, but I think just letting students use Chatgpt to create their writing entirely is not a good idea to improve their critical thinking. Instead, the teacher should give a lesson about the topic fully, and then teach students how to use Chatgpt critically for their writing as assistance. I assume that you mean to use it this way, but it seems your explanation lacks information about 'how to teach students to use AI well'.|
|R8	|The tools offer personalized learning, cooperative collaboration, and student-created materials for English learning. They also facilitate group work but may face challenges with content alignment and image consistency. And the example about image consistency was particularly striking.|
|R9	|It was very interesting to see three AI tools for the middle school students to enhance their comprehension, summarization, and presentation skills. The second tool, Leonardo AI to create images must be helpful for Ss to save some time when the third tool, ElevenLabs to convert simplified text into audio must support auditory learning and enhance presentation skills as it is explained in their introduction. However, using ChatGPT for Ss to summarize news articles looks very possible to reduce chances to improve their critical thinking, vocabulary, or grammar and syntax skills by summarizing. Thatâ€™s why it seems too early yet to use AI tools instead of Ssâ€™ creation unless there are enough systematic educational plans from my personal views.|
|R10|The idea to incorporate three AI tools is really impressive! I want to apply it in my class.	|
|R11|This lesson plan would reinforce our students to be professional L2 writers.	|
|R12|	Well done on organizing your ideas logically.|
|R13|I love how you showed how to integrate more than one digital tool!	|
|R14|One thing different from others is they tried to integrate various tools to organize a class. It's clear to understand, but using chat GPT4 would not be easy to use it right now because we have to pay for it.	|
